# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: July 20, 2022


**Today's Progress**: Learnt about the basic functionality of Haskell and its expressive syntax. Composed pictures and played around with combining functions.

**Thoughts:** The language is so expressive, it makes me like functional languages more. There is much less complexity involved in Haskell than in other functional languages like Java. I like that I didn't have to start by learning with boring text and integers: the tutorial dived right into the Picture function.
